        "**Asyncio** offers a lightweight alternative to traditional threading or multiprocessing for concurrency, primarily by leveraging **coroutines**, which are special functions defined with `async def` that can be paused and resumed. When you call a coroutine, it doesn't execute immediately; instead, it returns a coroutine object that represents a task to be performed. To actually run this task, you must `await` it, which schedules its execution within an **event loop**; this loop then efficiently manages all pending coroutines, allowing it to switch to and run other tasks while one coroutine is waiting (for example, on an I/O operation), thereby preventing the program from blocking."

        "In the context of programming, **threading** and **multiprocessing** are two distinct ways to achieve concurrency and parallelism:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Threading** involves running multiple independent sequences of instructions (threads) *within the same single program process*. These threads share the same memory space, making data sharing easy but also introducing complexity like race conditions and requiring careful synchronization. In Python, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), threads are best for **I/O-bound tasks** (where the program spends time waiting for external operations), as the GIL prevents true parallel execution of Python bytecode across multiple threads on multiple CPU cores.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Multiprocessing** involves running multiple independent programs (processes), each with its own separate memory space and its own Python interpreter instance. Because processes don't share memory directly, they communicate via Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms. Multiprocessing achieves true parallelism, making it ideal for **CPU-bound tasks** (where the program spends most time performing computations) because it bypasses Python's GIL."

        "\n",
        "In programming, the difference between **synchronous** and **asynchronous** primarily revolves around how tasks are executed and how a program handles waiting for operations to complete.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Synchronous programming** executes tasks one after another, sequentially. When a task starts, the program will **block** and wait for that task to fully complete before moving on to the next one, even if the task involves waiting (like fetching data from a website).\n",
        "* **Asynchronous programming**, conversely, allows tasks to run seemingly in parallel or concurrently. When a task involves waiting (e.g., an I/O operation like a network request), the program doesn't block; instead, it can switch to and perform other tasks while it waits for the first one to finish. Once the initial task is ready, the program can then resume it. This non-blocking nature makes asynchronous programming much more efficient for I/O-bound operations."

        "\n",
        "In Python, **`asyncio`** is a library that provides a framework for writing concurrent code using the `async`/`await` syntax. It's particularly well-suited for **I/O-bound** operations (tasks that spend most of their time waiting for external resources like network responses, disk I/O, or database queries) because it allows your program to perform other tasks while waiting, rather than blocking the entire program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Synchronous code:** Imagine a chef who can only do one thing at a time. If they're waiting for water to boil, they just stand there and do nothing else.\n",
        "  * **Asynchronous code (with `asyncio`):** Imagine a chef who, while waiting for water to boil, can chop vegetables, knead dough, or prep other ingredients. When the water boils, they come back to it. This makes them much more efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **`async`**: This keyword is used to define a **coroutine**. A coroutine is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed. When you call an `async` function, it doesn't execute immediately; instead, it returns a coroutine object.\n",
        "  * **`await`**: This keyword can only be used *inside* an `async` function. When you `await` an awaitable object (like another coroutine or `asyncio.sleep()`), it tells the event loop (the `asyncio` scheduler) that this coroutine can pause its execution at this point. While it's paused, the event loop can switch to and run other pending coroutines. Once the awaited operation is complete, the paused coroutine resumes from where it left off.\n",
        "  * **Event Loop**: This is the heart of `asyncio`. It's responsible for managing and executing coroutines. It keeps track of which coroutines are ready to run, which are waiting, and orchestrates the switching between them.\n",
        "  * **Task**: In `asyncio`, a coroutine that is scheduled to run on the event loop is wrapped in a `Task`. You can create tasks explicitly using `asyncio.create_task()` or implicitly when you `await` a coroutine.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example: Simulating I/O-bound operations\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's imagine we have three \"tasks\" that involve waiting for something (like fetching data from different websites). In a synchronous world, they would execute one after another, taking a total of 6 seconds. With `asyncio`, we can run them concurrently, significantly reducing the total time.\n"

        "1.  **`async def fetch_data(task_id, delay):`**: This defines an asynchronous function (a coroutine).\n",
        "2.  **`await asyncio.sleep(delay)`**: This is the core of the non-blocking behavior. When `fetch_data` encounters `await asyncio.sleep(delay)`, it tells the `asyncio` event loop: \"Hey, I'm going to be waiting for `delay` seconds. You can go run other tasks in the meantime.\" It *doesn't* block the entire program.\n",
        "3.  **`async def main():`**: This is our main coroutine, acting as the entry point for our asynchronous program.\n",
        "4.  **`task1 = asyncio.create_task(fetch_data(1, 3))`**: We create `Task` objects from our `fetch_data` coroutines. This schedules them to be run by the event loop. At this point, the `fetch_data` functions *have not yet started* executing their internal code.\n",
        "5.  **`results = await asyncio.gather(task1, task2, task3)`**:\n",
        "      * `asyncio.gather()` takes multiple awaitables (our tasks) and runs them concurrently.\n",
        "      * The `await` before `asyncio.gather()` means that the `main` coroutine will pause its execution *until all* of `task1`, `task2`, and `task3` have completed.\n",
        "6.  **`asyncio.run(main())`**: This is the entry point for running an `asyncio` application. It creates a new event loop, runs the `main()` coroutine until it completes, and then closes the loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Expected Output (approximately):**\n",

        "Notice that even though `Task 1` takes 3 seconds, `Task 2` takes 1 second, and `Task 3` takes 2 seconds, the total execution time is closer to 3 seconds (the longest running task). This is because while `Task 1` is \"sleeping\" (simulating I/O), the event loop is busy running `Task 2` and `Task 3`. This concurrent execution makes your program much more efficient for I/O-bound workloads.\n",

        "### Why it works in Colab (and not in a standard `.py` script):\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Automatic Event Loop:** When you execute a cell in Colab, there's usually an `asyncio` event loop already running or automatically started for you. This loop is what allows `await` to function at the top level of a cell.\n",
        "2.  **Top-Level `await`:** Interactive environments like Colab specifically enable \"top-level `await`.\" This means you don't need to explicitly wrap your `await` calls inside an `async def main():` function and then use `asyncio.run(main())`. The environment handles that orchestration for you.\n",

        "Colab sees the `await get_something()`, recognizes that `get_something()` is a coroutine, and uses its internal event loop to execute that coroutine and await its result.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Distinction:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Standard Python Script (`.py` file):** If you save the exact same code in a file named `my_script.py` and try to run it from your terminal (`python my_script.py`), you *will* get the `SyntaxError: 'await' outside async function`. This is because a standard Python script doesn't automatically provide an event loop or support top-level `await`.\n",

        "Let's break down what that means and why it's useful:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. Functions that can \"Pause and Resume\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of a regular function: when you call it, it runs from start to finish, uninterrupted, until it hits a `return` statement or an error. While it's running, it holds control, and no other part of your program can execute within the same thread.\n",
        "\n",
        "A coroutine is different. It's designed to:\n",
        "* **Run up to a certain point.**\n",
        "* **Voluntarily yield control** back to a scheduler (like the `asyncio` event loop).\n",
        "* **Pause its execution** at that point.\n",
        "* **Be resumed later** from exactly where it left off, picking up its local state (variables, position in code).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Cooperative Multitasking\n",
        "\n",
        "This \"yielding control\" is key to **cooperative multitasking**. Instead of the operating system forcibly switching between tasks (as in preemptive multitasking for threads/processes), coroutines *cooperate* by explicitly saying, \"I'm going to wait for a while, so you can go run something else.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "This is why `asyncio` is often called \"single-threaded concurrency.\" Your program isn't truly running multiple things at the *exact same instant* on different CPU cores (like threads often do). Instead, it's quickly switching between tasks whenever one task needs to wait for something (like an I/O operation).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. How Python Implements Coroutines\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, coroutines are implemented using the `async` and `await` keywords:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **`async def`**: This defines a function as a coroutine. When you call an `async def` function, it doesn't immediately execute its code. Instead, it returns a **coroutine object**. This object is essentially a callable \"future task\" that needs to be run by an event loop.\n",
        "* **`await`**: This keyword can *only* be used inside an `async def` function. When a coroutine encounters `await` followed by an \"awaitable\" object (like `asyncio.sleep()`, another coroutine, or a network request from an `async` library), it:\n",
        "    1.  **Pauses itself.**\n",
        "    2.  **Yields control** back to the `asyncio` event loop.\n",
        "    3.  Allows the event loop to **run other coroutines** that are ready.\n",
        "    4.  **Resumes** once the awaited operation is complete, continuing from the line after `await`.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Analogy: The \"Waitress\" Chef\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's revisit the chef analogy, but with a specific focus on the chef *being* the coroutine:\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine a chef (the coroutine) making multiple dishes.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **`async def prepare_soup():`**: This defines the \"prepare soup\" routine.\n",
        "2.  The chef starts preparing the soup.\n",
        "3.  **`await boil_water()`**: The chef gets to the point where they need to boil water. Instead of just standing there (blocking), they say, \"I'm going to wait for the water to boil, but in the meantime, I can work on something else.\" They *pause* preparing the soup and **yield control** to the kitchen manager (the event loop).\n",
        "4.  The kitchen manager (event loop) now checks if there are other tasks. \"Ah, the chef needs to chop vegetables for the salad!\"\n",
        "5.  **`async def chop_vegetables():`**: The chef (still the same one) switches context and starts chopping vegetables.\n",

        "#### 3. Output Guardrails\n",

        "\n",
        "This entire structure defines an **Agent** within the SDK, which is essentially an encapsulated Large Language Model (LLM) with specific instructions, capabilities, and behaviors for interacting within a larger system.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of its components:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **`name='DataScientist'`**: This is a unique identifier for this particular agent instance. It helps in referencing and distinguishing this agent from others in a multi-agent system.\n",
        "* **`instructions='You are a data scientist'`**: This is the most crucial part, acting as the primary system prompt for the underlying LLM. It defines the persona, role, and overarching goal of the agent, guiding its responses and actions.\n",
        "* **`prompt=None`**: This parameter, if provided, would specify an additional initial prompt or context for the LLM beyond the `instructions`. When `None`, the agent primarily relies on its instructions.\n",
        "* **`handoff_description=None`**: This would typically be a string describing what this agent intends to do before potentially handing off control to another agent. It's useful for clear communication in complex multi-agent workflows.\n",
        "* **`handoffs=[]`**: This is a list of `Handoff` objects. Each `Handoff` defines a potential transition point or interaction where this agent might pass control, information, or a task to another agent based on certain conditions. An empty list means this agent is not configured for explicit handoffs.\n",
        "* **`model='gpt-4o-mini'`**: Specifies the particular Large Language Model that this agent will use for its reasoning and text generation. `gpt-4o-mini` indicates a specific, likely more efficient, OpenAI model.\n",
        "* **`model_settings=ModelSettings(...)`**: This is a nested object containing fine-tuning parameters for the chosen LLM (`gpt-4o-mini` in this case).\n",
        "    * **`temperature=None`**: Controls the randomness of the output. Higher values mean more random, lower values mean more deterministic. `None` implies using the model's default.\n",
        "    * **`top_p=None`**: Controls the diversity of the output by sampling from the most likely tokens that sum up to `top_p` probability. `None` implies using the model's default.\n",
        "    * **`frequency_penalty=None`**: Penalizes new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, reducing repetition.\n",
        "    * **`presence_penalty=None`**: Penalizes new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, encouraging new topics.\n",
        "    * **`tool_choice=None`**: Controls how the model decides to use tools (e.g., `None` for auto-selection, or specific tool names).\n",
        "    * **`parallel_tool_calls=None`**: Whether the model can make multiple tool calls concurrently.\n",
        "    * Other `None` settings (`truncation`, `max_tokens`, `reasoning`, `metadata`, `store`, `include_usage`, `extra_query`, `extra_body`, `extra_headers`, `extra_args`) are for advanced configuration, often related to response length, internal reasoning steps, data storage, API usage details, or passing custom arguments to the underlying API calls.\n",
        "* **`tools=[]`**: This is a list of tools (functions or external services) that this `DataScientist` agent is equipped to use. An empty list means this agent currently has no specific tools it can call upon (e.g., for data analysis, plotting, or external API calls).\n",
        "* **`mcp_servers=[]`**: This is a list of connections to Model Context Protocol servers. These servers act as a layer that exposes specific functionalities (like file system access, web browsing, calendar tools, etc.) to the AI agent in a standardized way. The agent can automatically discover and use the tools provided by these servers.\n",
        "* **`mcp_config={}`**: This is a configuration dictionary for the Model Context Protocol itself. It holds advanced, protocol-level settings—such as whether to strictly convert tool schemas—that govern how the agent interacts with all of the MCP servers.\n",
        "* **`input_guardrails=[]`**: A list of `Guardrail` objects that define rules or conditions applied to any input received by this agent. These ensure incoming data meets certain criteria or adheres to safety guidelines.\n",
        "* **`output_guardrails=[]`**: A list of `Guardrail` objects that define rules or conditions applied to the agent's output. These ensure the agent's responses meet certain criteria before being released (e.g., preventing harmful content, enforcing format).\n",
        "* **`output_type=None`**: If specified, this would define the expected structure or format of the agent's final output (e.g., a specific JSON schema).\n",
        "* **`hooks=None`**: This parameter allows for injecting custom functions or logic at various stages of the agent's lifecycle (e.g., before processing input, after generating output).\n",
        "* **`tool_use_behavior='run_llm_again'`**: This dictates what the agent should do *after* it successfully uses a tool. `'run_llm_again'` means it will re-invoke the LLM after a tool call to process the tool's output and determine the next action. Other options might be to `return_result` directly.\n",
        "* **`reset_tool_choice=True`**: If `True`, after a tool call, the agent's internal state regarding tool selection might be reset, allowing it to freely choose any tool again in the next turn. If `False`, it might try to stick with the last chosen tool or a related one.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, this `Agent` configuration sets up a \"Data Scientist\" persona powered by `gpt-4o-mini`, ready to receive instructions, but currently without specific external tools, pre-defined handoffs to other agents, or explicit input/output validation rules beyond its core instructions."

        "An **OpenAI Trace** refers to a comprehensive record of events and operations that occur during the execution of an application or workflow built using OpenAI's tools, especially within the **OpenAI Agents SDK**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Essentially, it provides an \"observability\" layer, allowing developers to see what's happening behind the scenes in their LLM-powered applications. Here's a breakdown of what that entails:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Purpose:** The primary purpose of tracing is to debug, visualize, and monitor the behavior of your agent-based or LLM-driven workflows, both during development and in production. It helps you understand the flow, identify issues, and optimize performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Traces and Spans:**\n",
        "    * A **Trace** represents a single, end-to-end operation or \"workflow\" (e.g., a complete conversation with an AI agent, or a data analysis task). It provides a high-level view of the entire process.\n",
        "    * **Spans** are the individual, time-bound operations that make up a trace. Each span has a start and end time and contains detailed information about a specific step within the workflow.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **What is Traced (Examples of Spans):** The OpenAI Agents SDK, by default, traces a wide range of events, which are recorded as spans:\n",
        "    * **LLM Generations:** Records each time the LLM generates a response, including the prompt, the model used, the output, and potentially token usage and latency.\n",
        "    * **Tool Calls:** Details when the agent decides to use a tool, the arguments passed to it, and the tool's output.\n",
        "    * **Handoffs:** Tracks when control is passed from one agent to another.\n",
        "    * **Guardrails:** Records when input or output guardrails are applied and their results (e.g., if a prompt was flagged).\n",
        "    * **Custom Events:** Developers can also instrument their code to add custom spans for specific operations unique to their application.\n",
        "    * **Audio Inputs/Outputs:** For voice-enabled agents, it can trace speech-to-text transcription and text-to-speech generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Benefits:**\n",
        "    * **Debugging:** Pinpoint exactly where an agent might be making an incorrect decision, failing a tool call, or violating a guardrail.\n",
        "    * **Performance Monitoring:** Track latency, token usage, and cost for different parts of your workflow.\n",
        "    * **Visualization:** Many tracing systems provide dashboards to visually represent the flow of a trace, making complex agentic behaviors easier to understand.\n",
        "    * **Evaluation:** Collect data that can be used for offline or online evaluation of your agent's performance and quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **How it Works (Under the Hood):**\n",
        "    * Tracing is often built using standards like **OpenTelemetry**, which defines how telemetry data (traces, metrics, logs) is collected and exported.\n",
        "    * The OpenAI Agents SDK has built-in tracing capabilities that, by default, send this data to an OpenAI backend for visualization and analysis.\n",
        "    * Developers can usually configure or integrate with other observability platforms (like LangChain's LangSmith, MLflow, Arize, etc.) to manage and view their traces.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, an OpenAI Trace gives you deep visibility into the execution path of your LLM agents, transforming opaque black-box operations into transparent, debuggable workflows."

            "Dear fellow botanophiles and eco-enthusiasts, I am delighted to regale you with a verbose and lengthy exposition on the paramount importance of trees within the ecosystems that sustain our planet.\n",
            "\n",
            "As we embark upon this grand adventure, it is essential to understand that trees are not merely stationary sentinels, standing sentinel atop an otherwise featureless landscape. No, these arboreal colossi hold sway over nearly every facet of the natural world, exerting a profound influence on the delicate balance of our environmental ecosystem.\n",
            "\n",
            "First and foremost, let us consider the intrinsic biodiversity value of trees. These towering organisms serve as nurseries for an astonishing array of flora and fauna, providing sustenance and shelter for multitudes of species that migrate to their leafy canopies, twigs, and roots in quest of sustenance and refuge. From the tiniest microorganisms that inhabit the innermost recesses of tree trunks and branches to the majestic creatures that call trees home, such as owls, squirrels, and woodpeckers, trees are the very foundation upon which ecosystems build.\n",
            "\n",
            "Furthermore, the sheer scale and diversity of tree species renders them indispensable as ecological engineers. By virtue of their towering stature, canopies and roots, trees mediate a profound array of environmental processes, influencing local microclimates, moderating temperatures, and regulating precipitation patterns through an intricate interplay of symbiotic relationships with fungi and other microorganisms.\n",
            "\n",
            "In addition to these intrinsic benefits, trees also serve as pivotal actors within the global carbon cycle. Through photosynthesis, trees convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose, thereby sequestering atmospheric CO2 and releasing O2 as a byproduct. This biological process represents the most effective natural mechanism for mitigating the effects of climate change, with forests alone accounting for approximately 28% of global carbon sequestration efforts.\n",
            "\n",
            "Moreover, trees play a vital role in maintaining soil quality and water cycles. The extensive root systems of these arboreal organisms serve as vital sponges, absorbing rainwater during periods of drought and storing it in periphytic mounds, thereby recharging groundwater aquifers and contributing to the long-term sustainability of agricultural productivity.\n",
            "\n",
            "Moreover, trees possess unique spatial and temporal patterns that promote ecosystem resilience and complexity. Through seasonal oscillations in their photosynthetic activity, such as the deciduous cycle, trees induce cascading effects on herbivores and other organisms, allowing for an intricate ballet of predator-prey relationships and facilitating the co-evolution of plant-animal species.\n",
            "\n",
            "The economic benefits of tree maintenance must also be acknowledged. In many ecosystems, tree cover represents a significant commercial asset. Timber production, afforestation, and silvopastoral initiatives all capitalize on these biological stocks to generate revenue, create employment opportunities, and foster sustainable food systems.\n",
            "\n",
            "Beyond their intrinsic ecological value, trees hold spiritual and cultural significance for numerous communities around the world. Through rituals, ceremonial practices, and traditional knowledge traditions, humans have long communed with and integrated trees into the fabric of our lives. Our relationship with trees transcends simply their functional roles as producers or consumers; we find meaning in the ancient wisdom they impart.\n",
            "\n",
            "As we conclude this epic treatise on tree importance within ecosystems, it becomes increasingly evident that their role is not merely supporting or complementing biodiversity but serving as a bulwark against deforestation and ecological degradation. Tree conservation must integrate diverse governance structures, policy frameworks, and market-based incentives to safeguard these vital resources for future generations.\n",
            "\n",
            "Let us all recognize the importance of these arboreal sentinels in preserving ecosystem health, mitigating climate change, ensuring foodsecurity, promoting cultural heritage preservation, and conserving biodiversity — inasmuch as we strive towards a sustainable and thriving global community that venerates and coexists with our majestic tree neighbors.\n",
